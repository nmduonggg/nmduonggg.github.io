<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Duong M. Nguyen is currently a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) where he is working with [Prof. Minh N. Do](https://minhdo.ece.illinois.edu/). Prior to UIUC, he obtained his B.Sc. degree (advanced program) at the [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Phi Le Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L_NKoQwAAAAJ&hl=en) and was a research assistant in [Institute for AI Innovation and Societal Impact (AI4LIFE)](https://ai4life.hust.edu.vn/).

His research interests focus on developing computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) for AI in Healthcare. This spans in two main lines: (1) Improve model efficiency under heterogenous settings via federated learning and dataset condensation and (2) Developing AI solutions for medical image processing problems (e.g., histopathological imaging, time-lapsed imaging and cell growth). Due to sensitivity and variability of medical data, he wants to combine two these research domains to build a privacy-aware, computationally efficient, and powerful AI platform in healthcare for everyone. 

He was honored to receive the Best Presentation Award in Graduation Thesis Defense at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology.
